Assumptions:

original *.desktop files are in top level of git folder
name of parent folder above translations-desktop is the name of the project, at least for transifex purposes

initial setup

1.  place translations-desktop folder in top level of git repo. 
2.  in the "destkop-in" folder, place stripped down versions of hte original desktop files
    the only strings translated will be those in the new desktop-in/*.desktop.in files
    
3.  run "./update-po-mo.sh pot" to generate a pot file for uploading to transifex
4.  run "./update-po-mo.sh po" to generate po files for uploading to transifex
5.  upload pot file to transifex.  don't upload any po files for a few minutes to give transifex time to process the pot file
6.  run "./get_original_strings.sh" to popular po files with existing strings from existing desktop files
7.  update po files with translations to transifex.  uploadlist.txt will have list of changed lang files with harvested strings
    to upload


in future, ./get_translations will be used to update po files from transifex.
after ./get_translations, run "make desktop" to generate new desktop files and then 
copy those from the build folder to the usual place in the git repo.

get_original_strings is a one-time deal.  after strings are uploaded to transifex it should
not be used anymore.
