<h1>HELP: MX Tweak</h1>
<p>MX Tweak brings together a number of small but often used customizations. Related settings applications native to Xfce are presented below for the user&#8217;s convenience.</p>

<h2>Panel</h2>

<p>Allows the user to make quick user interface changes to system defaults.</p>

<img src="1-2a.jpg" alt="MX Tweak" />

<p>The user may select to display the default panel horizontally (top or bottom) or vertically (left&#8211;default&#8211;or right).  Customizations, including panel plugins,will be preserved, although plugin location might be altered. </p>

<p>A backup of the current panel is stored in ~/.restore/.  A backup is created on first launch of the app, and a new backup may be made at anytime.  Multiple backups are supported.</p>

<p>The user may use the &#8220;Restore default panel&#8221; to get back to the original, as-shipped panel.</p>

<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>If you want to export a panel configuration from one computer to another, with both running MX-21 or later, copy the tar.xz file that you want from &#8220;~./restore/&#8221; folder from the original computer and paste it in &#8220;~/.restore/&#8221; of the second computer, and use the &#8220;Restore backup panel configuration&#8221; option to &#8220;import&#8221; the migrated panel.</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Theme</h2>

<img src="tweak-theme-1.jpg" alt="Xfce Theme options" />

<p>Xfce & Fluxbox users user may select Gtk theme, window manager theme, icon theme and cursor theme on this tab.  The user can also use pre-configured theme sets from the drop down combo box.</p>
<p> The user can also save their current gtk, window manager, and icon theme settings to a new theme set.  The theme-set will be saved in <span style="font-style: normal">~/.local/share/mx-tweak-data.</span></p>
<p> Fluxbox users get a link to the provided mxfb-look tool that can store theme combination sets.</p>


<h2>Compositor</h2>

<p>Here the user may select whether to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager" aria-label="compositing window manager">compositing window manager</a>, and which compositor to use.</p>

<img src="tweak-compositor-2.jpg" alt="Compositor" />

<h3>Xfwm (Xfce) compositor</h3>

<p>Xfwm is the default window manager for Xfce, and it includes its own compositor. That compositor is turned off by default in MX Linux because it can cause various problems on older machines. When you turn on its compositor by selecting it from the pull-down menu, the button &#8220;Xfwm Settings&#8221; becomes active and, when clicked, provides access to some basic settings. For details, consult the <a href="https://wiki.xfce.org/howto/xfwm4_theme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Xfce Wik (opens in a new tab)">Xfce Wik</a>i.</p>

<p>Under Xfce 4.14 and up, the user can set the “Vblank” mode to auto, glx, xpresent, or off.</p>

<p><strong>glx</strong> - Anecdotally,
this seems to work well with intel cards and some nvidia/ati cards</p>
<p><strong>xpresent</strong> - uses the
xpresent libraries. Anecdotally, this seems to work well with newer
ati/amd cards.</p>
<p><strong>off</strong> - this disables
the vblank code. Anecdotally, this seems to work well with nvidia
cards.</p>

<h3>Compton compositor</h3>

<p><a aria-label="Compton" href="https://github.com/chjj/compton">Compton</a> is often used instead of Xfwm to reduce the kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing" aria-label="screen tearing">screen tearing</a> that sometimes troubles lightweight compositors such as Xfwm. MX Tweak gives you an easy way to start, stop, and configure the Compton compositor.  </p>

<p>At launch, a compton.conf configuration file will be created for you in ~/.config if one doesn&#8217;t already exist.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Stop Compton&#8221; button will change to &#8220;Launch Compton&#8221; if its not running.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Configure Compton&#8221; button will launch compton-conf, an LXqt project configuraiton tool for compton.  The compton-conf configuration tool works best with the compton.conf file included with the package.  Changes made by compton-conf will take affect at the &#8220;apply&#8221; button.</p>

<img src="mxcompton-2-1.jpg" alt="" />

<p>If you have an existing compton.conf file, or want to change settings not available in the gui, the &#8220;Edit compton.conf&#8221; button will open ~/.compton.conf in a text editor for you to edit directly.  Use the Start-Stop button to cycle compton for manual changes to take affect.</p>

<p>The &#8220;launch at login&#8221; checkmark will enable autostart of compton. this works if the compton file is the in the default location of ~/.config/compton.conf.</p>

<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>The xfce compositor will be disabled when compton is launched with the mx compton manager.</li>
		<li>If you have an existing compton.conf file, it may not work with the gui compton-conf tool.</li>
		<li>Some users have found that screen tearing can be reduced by setting Compton to autostart with the command:
			<ul>
				<li><em>compton &#8211;backend glx &#8211;paint-on-overlay &#8211;vsync opengl-swc</em></li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Config Options</h2>

<img src="4-1.jpg" alt="config" />

<p>Config options contains a few special items pertaining to the Xfce system configuration.  Most items are self-explanatory.</p>

<p>Occasionally the thunar custom right-click actions maybe be updated.  While these updated configurations will be present on the system, they will not go into effect automatically for upgraders.   The &#8220;Reset&#8221; actions will change any thunar custom actions to the latest MX defaults.</p>

<h2>Fluxbox</h2>

<img src="fluxbox-1.jpg" alt="fluxbox" />

<p>This tab is only visible when the user is running MX-Fluxbox.</p>

	<ul>
    <li>Reset defaults. Checking any of these items will replace the existing file(s) with the original released version. This includes the dock script, the root menu shown with a right click on the desktop) or the config files (init, startup, keys, etc.).</li>
    <li>Desktop Icons. These items are elements of iDesk (the program that draws icons on the mx-fluxbox desktop) that are otherwise not easily accessible. For more options, use mx-idesktool.</li>
    <li>Toolbar settings. Common settings for the Fluxbox Toolbar which are not easily found by new users. This is not the tint2 panel, which is controlled by the tint2-manager settings tool.</li>
    <li>Dock (slit) settings. The docks are created by scripts that join launchers together and locate them at one of the desktop locations called slits. Here the user can easily change dock location or visibility. For more options, use mx-dockmaker or consult in a terminal the detailed man file to see the many possibilities available for wmalauncher, the program that powers the docks.</li>
	<li>A link is provided to launch the tint2-manager panel settings app.</li>
	</ul>
	
<p>A more detailed description of these and other Fluxbox settings is provided by the FAQ document (F1 or Menu > Help).</p>

<h2>Plasma</h2>

<img src="plasma.jpg" alt="plasma" />

<p>This tab is only visible when the user is running KDE/Plasma.</p>

<p>Most items are self-explanatory.  Due to plasma's complexity, users are encouraged to use the KDE plasma System Settings tools to do plasma configuration.</p>

<h2>Display</h2>

<img src="display-1.jpg" alt="Display" /> <img src="tray-app-1.jpg" alt="System Tray" />


<p>On MX19 and later, a Display tab is available.  Here you can control the backlight, xrandr brightness, resolution, gtk scaling and the hidden xrandr scaling available under Xfce</p>


	<ul>
		<li>GTK scaling accepts only whole number scaling. This is the same as the scaling available under the Xfce Appearance application</li>
		<li>Xrandr scaling accepts fractional scales.  These values will be saved in the standard xfconf system, so Xfce will automatically apply them on restart of Xfce</li>
		<li>The backlight control will be available on systems with an exposed backlight interface under /sys/class/brightness.  This is mostly laptops and all-in-one devices.</li>
        <li>The Software brightness slider controls the brightness through the xrandr interface and should work on external as well as internal monitors. Clicking "Save" will preserve the current setting across reboots</li>
        <li>For convenience, the resolution can also be set here.  This controls the same settings as the Xfce Display application</li>
        <li>A system tray application for controlling the brightness is also available.  A menu entry is provided, or start MX-Tweak with the --tray switch.</li>
        <li>Left-clicking the system tray icon will give the popup brightness control shown.</li>
        <li>Right-clicking the system tray icon will present an option to open the full MX-Tweak display tab</li>
        <li>In the tray application, clicking the >> button will expose any backlight control available.</li>
        <li>All settings except for backlight and GTK scaling on are a per-user and per-display basis.  Select the proper Display from the Dropdown box.</li>
	</ul>
    
<h2>Other</h2>

<img src="5-1.jpg" alt="other options" />

<p>Configuration options on this tab require admin privledges before they go into effect.  The user will be prompted for the current admin password on apply.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Occasionally the lightdm configuration maybe be updated.  While these updated configurations will be present on the system, they will not go into effect automatically for upgraders.   The &#8220;Reset&#8221; actions will change any lightdm configuration to the latest MX defaults.</li>
		<li>Enable of kernel sandbox is only available on kernels that have a switch for user namespaces built in.  Some kernels default to off, some default to on.  Enabling this feature is useful for a lot of applications that require sandboxes.</li>
		<li>Enable mounting of internal drives by standard users (no admin password required).</li>
		<li>Allow or disallow auto starting of bluetooth devices when bluetooth managers load.  Requiers a reboot to go into effect.</li>
		<li>If a root account is configured, the option to choose what password to use for gui admin prompts will be enabled.  Goes into effect immediately.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<p>The graphics driver entries vary depending on what video adapter is installed on the system.  If a intel graphics board is detected, the user will be presented with the option show above, which will force the system to use the &#8220;intel&#8221; driver rather than the debian default &#8220;modesetting&#8221; driver.  The &#8220;intel&#8221; configuration also includes a &#8220;tear free&#8221; option that many find helps with screen tearing.   </p>

<p>If the user has an amd graphics part, then the user will be offered a choice to enable the &#8220;tear free&#8221; option for the radeon or amdgpu drivers, which ever is in current use.  The actual driver choice will not be changed, just the &#8220;tear free&#8221; option.<br></p>


<h3>Details</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>There is a template file in /usr/share/mx-tweak-data that folks can use to build theme sets. The file should also be copied into ~/.local/share/mx-tweak-data. also, user files stored in ~/.local/share/mx-tweak-data will be picked up by mx-tweak on start of the app.</li>
	</ul>
